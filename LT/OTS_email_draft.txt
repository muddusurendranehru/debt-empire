Dear Gagan P / L&T Finance Team,

Thank you for your response (Ref: !00D2v02GLH0.!500No0c2FZl:ref).

Before visiting a branch, kindly provide:
1. The Hyderabad branch address where OTS requests are processed for retail loans
2. Name/designation of the officer handling OTS for account BL240910207908339
3. List of documents required for OTS submission

This will help me prepare the necessary paperwork and avoid multiple visits.

Thank you,
Dr. Muddu Surendra Nehru
