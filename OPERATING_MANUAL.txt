==================================================

OPENING THE APP:

ADDING NEW LOAN:
  1. Extractor tab → Drag document
  2. Fill ONLY: Account Number + Current OS (₹)
  3. Click "EXTRACT GOOD → NEXT: VERIFIER"
  4. If modal appears → Choose carefully:
        🔗 USE EXISTING → Add details to existing loan
        ➕ CREATE NEW → Keep as separate loan
  5. Verifier tab → Click 🖨️ → Save as PDF → Email to lender

PRINTING FOR LENDER:
  → Manager tab → Find loan → Click 🖨️ → Ctrl+P → "Save as PDF"
  → Lender sees ONLY their loan details (no other accounts)

MONTHLY BACKUP:
  → Manager tab → "⬇️ Export Loans as CSV" → Save to records folder
  → THIS IS YOUR PRIVATE BACKUP (never share full CSV with lenders)

IMPORTANT:
  • Always use SAME METHOD to open app (file vs localhost)
  • Never attach full CSV to lender emails (only 1 loan per email)
  • Print button = lender communication | CSV = your private backup
