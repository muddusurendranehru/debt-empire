### ✨ PROFESSIONAL FRAMING FOR OTS OFFICER

> *"This monthly expense tracker shows consistent operational costs despite negligible income:  
> - February 2024: ₹26,700 in expenses with ₹0 income  
> - Total net loss: ₹26,700 for the month  
> - Cumulative losses growing month-to-month  
>   
> These documented losses prove the clinic was fundamentally unsustainable despite my good faith efforts to keep it operational. I sold my property to repay debts but require OTS for residual liabilities."*

### 🔒 EVIDENCE INTEGRITY CHECK

### 🚫 CRITICAL DON'Ts

| ❌ DON'T | ✅ DO INSTEAD |
|----------|---------------|
| Add unverified expenses | Only include expenses with bank statement proof |
| Mix personal and clinic expenses | Keep clinic expenses strictly separate |
| Hide monthly loss pattern | Emphasize consistent business failure |
| Overstate expenses | Use exact amounts from bank statements |

2. **Update monthly**: Keep loss pattern current
3. **Highlight**: "₹0 income" with growing expenses = unsustainable business
4. **Connect**: Show how expenses directly supported patient care
