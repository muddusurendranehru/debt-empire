### ✨ PROFESSIONAL FRAMING

> *"February 2024 shows the clinic generated zero income while incurring ₹26,700 in legitimate operational expenses.  
> This demonstrates the unsustainable business model:  
> - Required continuous funding despite no revenue  
> - All expenses directly supported patient care operations  
> - Documented loss pattern growing month-to-month  
>   
> I sold my investment property to repay debts but require OTS for residual liabilities."*

### 🔒 EVIDENCE INTEGRITY

> *"All expenses verified against bank statements.  
> Zero income confirmed by clinic revenue records.  
> No personal funds commingled with clinic operations.  
> Primary residence remains legally protected from unsecured business debt."*
