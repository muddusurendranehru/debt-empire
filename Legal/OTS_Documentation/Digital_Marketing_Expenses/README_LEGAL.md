### ⚠️ HOW TO PRESENT TO OTS OFFICER

1. **Do NOT say**: "These are my exact bills"  
2. **DO say**:  
   > *"These are approximate operational expenses for legitimate clinic outreach.  
   > I maintained digital presence to educate patients on metabolic health — a core part of my medical practice.  
   > Actual payment records can be retrieved from bank statements if required by court."*

3. **Emphasize**:  
   > *"As a physician-educator, digital outreach was not optional — it was essential to reach 300+ villages in Godavarikhani region where physical clinics are inaccessible."*
