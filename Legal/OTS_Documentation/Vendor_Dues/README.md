### 💡 HOW TO PRESENT TO OTS OFFICER
1. **Say**:  
   > *"These vendor dues show I invested all capital in legitimate clinic operations.  
   > Despite this investment, the business failed due to [reason].  
   > I've sold my property to repay debts but still require OTS for residual liabilities."*

2. **DO NOT say**:  
   > *"I need OTS because I spent money on personal expenses."*  
   *(This weakens your position)*

3. **EMPHASIZE**:  
   > *"Every rupee went to Homa Clinic operations — no personal misuse."*

### 🚨 CRITICAL DOs & DON'Ts

| ✅ DO | ❌ DON'T |
|------|---------|
| Present vendor dues as proof of legitimate investment | Call them "debts I can't pay" |
| Show exact amounts paid to vendors | Inflate numbers |
| Emphasize "all capital went to clinic" | Mention personal expenses |
| Keep evidence separate from court case | Mix OTS and legal evidence |
