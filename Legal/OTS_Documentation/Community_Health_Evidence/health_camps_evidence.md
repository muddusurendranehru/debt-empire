| Claim all camps were profitable | Show documented community service focus |
| Hide discount offers | Emphasize "40% discount" as proof of patient accessibility |
| Mix with personal expenses | Keep health camp evidence strictly medical practice |
| Overstate camp numbers | Use "10+ documented camps" (truthful but strategic) |
